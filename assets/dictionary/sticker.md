A sticker (stamp) is a type of cosmetic in the game. There are 2 types of stickers: character illustrations and text stickers. Character illustrations are drawings of 1 or 2 characters and text above them, for example, a Miku stamp with the caption "Start the music!". Text stickers only include text, for example, "N25!", "VBS!", and special ones like "Happy White Day!". Stickers can be used across the game when making a custom profile, as well as interacting with users in virtual shows.
